This is a work in progress, where I'm keeping my work about
making a full walking onions spec and design.

  PLAN.txt is my current checklist

  OUTLINE0.txt is my working top-level outline

  UNCERTAINTY.txt is where I'm checking off areas of uncertainty.

  notes/ is where I'm putting topic-specific notes as I write them.

  specs/ is where I'm outlining and writing individual specs.

  updates/ has my weekly updates.

I'm calling all of this stuff cc0; see LICENSE.
