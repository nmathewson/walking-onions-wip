MUST DECIDE BEFORE WRITING BASICALLY ANYTHING

  o What metaformat to use for the SNIPs?   ✔
  o What metaformat to use for the ENDIVE?   ✔
  o How do ENDIVE diffs work?   ✔

MUST DECIDE BEFORE WRITING TOO MUCH

 o Any point in investigating non-merkle-tree authentication?  ✗

 o How will all the timestamps work, approximately?  ✔
   o so, snip and endive timestamps can be a bit independent.
   o stick timestamps in the signature, let them be part of the nonce.

 o How do we keep V2 hs directory working?   ✔
 o Can we avoid needing to have an absolutely-up-to-date root document?  ✔

 o Which elements do we need to keep in SNIPs from current rs+md combo? ✔

 - Can we kill off TAP wrt v2 HS?

 - How to do per-day shifts of v3 HS ring?

 - How will bridges work?
   - Guess: need a self-signed own-snip thing.

 - How can we prevent relays from deciding which timestamped SNIPs
   to answer with?
     - (outline: enforce 'published' time moving monotonically forward.)

 - Need to do a topology future-proofing.  How does that work?  Probably
   tag indices with groups, SNIPs with groups?

 - What are all the node selection rules we need to keep working?
 - How do we keep exit port selection working?

 - How small does the root-document (remaining parts of the consensus) need
   to be?

 - How do we do migration?  Can we keep the network useful? Can we get any
   benefit before all/most relays are updated?  Do we partition?

 - Will we try to future-proof for fancy future features, like:
     - single-pass circuit construction
     - fancy toplogies

  - How large should we let the scope become?
     - Do we try to do any tricks to generate md consensuses better?
     - Do we try for a unified MD consensus as well?


AT ANY POINT

  - What hash to use for the merkle tree? (if any)
  - Do we make ed keys any bigger?
