This is a quick kludge to analyze properties of exit policies on the Tor
network.  And to learn a little rust.

Things to try:

  # Get a count of how many policies support each port.
  cargo run --release portcount ./cached_microdescs.new

  # Get a disjoint set of port-sets such that every policy is the union
  # of some combination of those port-sets.
  cargo run --release cover ./cached-microdescs.new

  # In the port-sets above, analyze which ones can be "combined" with which
  # others without "losing" the ability to express too many of the policies.
  #
  # Do this iteratively until only 16 policies remain.
  cargo run --release greedy-16 ./cached-microdescs.new

(Remember to use --release, or rustc won't optimize, and you'll get slow
code.)
