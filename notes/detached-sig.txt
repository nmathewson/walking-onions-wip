Suppose that we move to one of those postquantum signature algorithms
with huge signatures.  Or suppose we decide not to use threshold
signatures and we need a workable multisignature algorithm.  Both of
those would cause us to have huge SNIPs, which we're trying to avoid.

So what we could do instead is stick the signature in a detached thing
which you only have to download once.  I guess not the root document,
since that's only fetched occasionally.  Instead it could be a detached
signature that authenticates a merkle root.  In that case, instead of a
signature at the SNIP root we could have a reference to _which_ detached
signature wer're using (since multiple ENDIVEs exist).  Better have a
digest and a date.
