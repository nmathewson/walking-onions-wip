# topology and future-proofing

We'd like to have a split-ENDIVES mechanism so that we can eventually support
more complicated net topologies where group 1 connects to group 2 connects to
group 3.  You only need the ENDIVE for your own group.

Seems that this part of the design writes itself: we put every relay in a
group.  We add a "group" field to the signature parameters: you _have_ to
know the preceding group in order to check the signature.

     (XXX Or do you?  this means that you can't show somebody else a SNIP
     without saying which group gave it to you.  Might have to tweak that
     idea. Or have a "comprehensive index" that every relay is in, and you
     just fetch your own.)

You'll have to know your own group to get an ENDIVE.  Not sure how to find
your own group.  Ping authorities?  Leave unspecified?  Maybe an "ENDIVE-for"
download URL that redirects to the ENDIVE you want.

The authorities could lie though, so there should be at least one additional
signed thing saying "relay x is in group G".

Moving things between groups seems quite hairy.  If the relay referring
clients to you says you are in group X but you have an endive that says you
are in group Y, what happens?

============================================================

Other option: index mapping.  We list indices by functionality in the root
document.  (e.g., "middle = 2").  Then we say somehow say later that "middle
= 2 from group X, 3 from group Y."
