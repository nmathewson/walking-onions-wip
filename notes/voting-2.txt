Use SoftwareDescription in votes???




Hey, here is a thing.  Let's make the voting rules actually good enough to
handle everything, then describe how to apply them.  Make these detached from
the voted-upon things.

Define these rules using some basic combinator stuff.  Then use them to
compute 99% of the stuff in the ENDIVE.

Define collation using another rule.





Still not sure how indices work and how Wxx weights happen.
