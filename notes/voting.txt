How does voting work????


Let's try to do it the same way as we do it with microdescs consensuses
and voting now, and see whether any changes are needed.

Do we have a dual format for legacy voting?


Maybe we can stick the _best_ microdescriptor format for each authority in the
vote, along with the hashes of the others.  Helps votes, and ensures
you've got what you need.

Then maybe we can think about a "unified" consensus that contains
microdescriptor text.  Using diffs to transfer should make that cheap?
Ish?  Would be another issue though.

We could do the same thing about authority certs; they are very
diff-friendly too. (Wait, we _do_ stick authority certs in votes.)

Some kind of chunked encoding/transfer might be smart.

Vote as now: build ENDIVE as follows:

     - IndexGroups are:

XXXX

     - ENDIVERouterBody are:

XXX

     - then run reconstruction algorithm to find hash roots, and sign!

How does transfer work????

Can we just tread ENDIVEs like a kind of consensus and use the same
stuff, with X-or-diff-from replaced with X-or-cbor-diff-from?  I hope
so.

Same list-of-keys thing or a different one?

Do we stick more certificates in ENDIVEs?  If we have and use diffs then we
don't need separate certs.
