KEY ideas

A family is now identified, from a client's POV, by an ID that all the family
members share.  Relays may have multiple family IDs.  Any two relays are in
the same family iff they have the same family ID.

Family IDs can be generated by authorities from legacy lists of keys, OR by
using some kind of authentication-and-certification mechanism.

Need to specify an algorithm for the former.

Need to specify a mechanism for the latter.
