Need to do a revised instance of proposal 245-tap-out.txt, explaining how to
get rid of TAP for hidden services entirely.

If we allow SNIPs in v2 onion services, then over time, we can flip a switch
to put them in, and another switch to use them.  (Assuming v2 onion services
live forever.)

In parallel can put ntor keys in descriptors.

Once TAP is no longer used in v2 onion services, we can drop it entirely.
